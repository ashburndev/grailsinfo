# davidholrepo1
created via google chrome browser running on MS Windows 10 at URL https://github.udev2dev.com/new

I used a laptop (MS Windows 10) running the Google Chrome browser and the URL https://github.udev2dev.com/new to create this private "davidholrepo1" repository.

I created a README.md file and .gitignore file (the latter using the "rails" template

```
*.rbc
capybara-*.html
.rspec
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/db/*.sqlite3-[0-9]*
/public/system
/coverage/
/spec/tmp
*.orig
rerun.txt
pickle-email-*.html

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# TODO Comment out this rule if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
config/initializers/secret_token.rb
config/master.key

# Only include if you have production secrets in this file, which is no longer a Rails default
# config/secrets.yml

# dotenv
# TODO Comment out this rule if environment variables can be committed
.env

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
/vendor/assets/bower_components
*.bowerrc
bower.json

# Ignore pow environment settings
.powenv

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

# Ignore node_modules
node_modules/

# Ignore precompiled javascript packs
/public/packs
/public/packs-test
/public/assets

# Ignore yarn files
/yarn-error.log
yarn-debug.log*
.yarn-integrity

# Ignore uploaded files in development
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
```
